<h1> Woody Butler's Leadership Playbook </h1>
<p> The purpose of this page is to provide open access to a summary of the lessons we've learned in Entrepreneurial Leadership at Tufts
	(Spring 2016, Prof. Elizabeth McCarthy). The format of the report as seen below is individual lessons and concepts explored in 
	one page each. A website was chosen for the format for the ease of access and modularity for future use.
</p>


Each lesson should include (a) why the lesson resonates with you (b) a story that brings this to life, i.e., when you gave someone feedback and what happened (c) how you'll embrace this lesson in the future.  The stories are key.  This is your personal leadership playbook.  It should not read like a summary of things we discussed in class - you need to personalize and bring the lessons to life in ways that are relatable to you.  Given what you'll need to cover for each lesson - you should assume that each lesson will include ~ 3 paragraphs.
